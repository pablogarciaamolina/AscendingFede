## Project Description
AscendingFede is a Unity-based game that revolves (quite literally) around a tower. Grounded on the indie **FEZ**, it expands the original's functionalities by applying the concepts learned throughout the subject *Paradigmas de Programación*. Set in a medieval environment, the game will have the player control a knight's movements in order to get to the tower's apex.

Out of all the new exciting functionalities, we must highlight a system of power-ups and different kinds of platforms that modify the player's conditions (to put in the knowledge obtained on *OOP*). In addition to this, the player will have to deal with an extra factor; an enemy.

Therefore, the player's quest will not be as easy as it seems. The enemy, an evil dragon (who represents our deepest fears as well as communism), will follow the player as it climbs the tower. While this happens, the dragon, pushed forward by wicked and ancient ideas (communism), will shoot fireballs (depicting the constant hunger its victims suffer) at the knight, aiming to throw him off his quest.

The last thing we have to mention is that the dragon, in order to make it even harder for the player, will constantly learn newer and smarter ways of following the player and shooting him (function implemented by means of *MLAgents*)

## Development Partitions
Given the extent of the project, the first days of its blooming were devoted towards breaking it down into specific parts, which we designated as *Systems*. This had a double objective: Making the development much more tangible by establishing particular goals and making the tasks' distiribution between the 3 components of the group easier.

Thus, (insert number of systems) different systems were identified, which we'll describe in the next paragraphs:

###### SMC: Camera Movement System
First of all, we focused on one of the coolest and most differentiating features of the game, this is, its camera. Even though the game is built in a 3D world, the player's perspective only features 2 dimensions, following the knight around the tower. To access the additional dimension, the player has the power of changing the camera perspective between 4 different positions (_looking_ at each face of our quadrangular tower).

This system, designated SMC, Camera Movement System, for its initials in Spanish, (Explain more about the SMC)...

###### SMP: Player's Movement System

###### SIPCP: Camera-player perspective integration system

###### SI: Inputs System

###### SP: Player's System

###### SIEO: Interaction between Objects System
Explain

###### SMCD: Dragon's Control and Movement System

## Installing and Running the Game
Download them files together with the provided 3TB of CP and enjoy (we don't take liability for any problem with the law enforcement).

## How to use the Game
Just keep edgin', mate. That's the aim towards becoming a sigma

Yall sus AF bruh

## Credits
This game was programmed as final project for the subject *Paradigmas de Programación* of the 3rd year of *Ingeniería Matemática e Inteligencia Artificial*, ICAI. As such, it was meant to wrap up all theory learnt throughtout the course. Created by Pablo García Molina, Andrés Martínez Fuentes and Fco. Javier Ríos Montes, this game is but the first of a list of projects done by these three fantastic people.

A big shout out to both our teachers, Arturo Serrano and Daniel Morell, for making it so much manageable all through the weeks of development.
