## Project Description
AscendingFede is a Unity-based game that revolves (quite literally) around a tower. Grounded on the indie **FEZ**, it expands the original's functionalities by applying the concepts learned throughout the subject *Paradigmas de Programación*. Set in a medieval environment, the game will have the player control a knight's movements in order to get to the tower's apex.

Out of all the new exciting functionalities, we must highlight a system of power-ups and different kinds of platforms that modify the player's conditions (to put in the knowledge obtained on *OOP*). In addition to this, the player will have to deal with an extra factor; an enemy.

Therefore, the player's quest will not be as easy as it seems. The enemy, an evil dragon (who represents our deepest fears as well as communism), will follow the player as it climbs the tower. While this happens, the dragon, pushed forward by wicked and ancient ideas (communism), will shoot fireballs (depicting the constant hunger its victims suffer) at the knight, aiming to throw him off his quest.

The last thing we have to mention is that the dragon, in order to make it even harder for the player, will constantly learn newer and smarter ways of following the player and shooting him (function implemented by means of *MLAgents*)

## Credits
This game was programmed as final project for the subject *Paradigmas de Programación* of the 3rd year of *Ingeniería Matemática e Inteligencia Artificial*, ICAI. As such, it was meant to wrap up all theory learnt throughtout the course. Created by Pablo García Molina, Andrés Martínez Fuentes and Fco. Javier Ríos Montes, this game is but the first of a list of projects done by these three fantastic people.

A big shout out to both our teachers, Arturo Serrano and Daniel Morell, for making it so much manageable all through the weeks of development.
